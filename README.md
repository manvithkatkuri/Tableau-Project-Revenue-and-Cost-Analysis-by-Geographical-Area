## Objectives

1. **Revenue and Cost Breakdown**:
   - Analyze and visualize revenue and costs across geographical areas.
   - Drill-down capabilities to explore data by country and supplier.

2. **Proportion Analysis**:
   - Show the proportional contribution of net revenue generated by each country.

3. **Supplier Performance**:
   - Examine the net revenue generated by individual suppliers.
